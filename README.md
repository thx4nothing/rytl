# rytl
RSS YouTube Feed

# Requirements


# Usage instructions
Create a channels.txt file with the channel ids. One per line.

Start the app through rss.lnk (Python 3.9 installed in C:\Python39) for background usage. Or just start the rss.py file.

The files need to be placed in C:/rytl or it needs to be changed in the rss.py file. I will try to add some config files in the future, but for now this is how it works.
